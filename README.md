## Project contains the following:
- 'fonts': folder containing font files used in the site
- 'icons': folder containing icon files used in the floating action bar (FAB)
- 'FAB-test.html': practice file I used to create the FAB
- 'index.html': the big cool file you open to get the project running :D
  - This contains elements including the overall layout of the site and elements/scripting for the graph and FAB
- 'style.css': CSS file to style the entire site
  - Note: this will be further refined in the future
- 'tempLogo.png': a PNG for acting as a placeholder logo when I refine the navbar in the near future

## Features:
- An animated graph displaying the user's availability over a given period of time
- An animated FAB that will be used to add, remove, and edit user tasks
- A (currently unrefined) navbar
- A footer with links :P

Thanks for stopping by! Extra features will be added and this repo will be updated.
