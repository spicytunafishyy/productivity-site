## Project contains the following:
- Base HTML, CSS and JS files under "graphing-site" directory
- React version ("graphing-site-react") of what I currently have integrated into React.
  
- 'fonts': folder containing font files used in the site
- 'icons': folder containing icon files used in the floating action bar (FAB) and navbar
- 'used-pages': Folder containing base HTML, CSS and JS for site
  - This contains elements including the overall layout of the site and elements/scripting for the graph and FAB
- 'wip-pages': Folder containing files that are unfinished, but will be updated in the future

## Features:
- An animated graph displaying the user's availability over a given period of time
- An animated FAB that will be used to add, remove, and edit user tasks
- "Add Events" menu that allows the user to add any number of events to particular days on the graph
- Footer with (some) links

Thanks for stopping by! Extra features will be added and this repo will be updated.
