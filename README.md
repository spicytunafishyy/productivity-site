## Project contains the following:
- 'fonts': folder containing font files used in the site
- 'icons': folder containing icon files used in the floating action bar (FAB)
- 'FAB-test.html': practice file I used to create the FAB
- 'index.html': the big cool file you open to get the project running :D
  - This contains elements including the overall layout of the site, 
- 'style.css': CSS file to style the entire site
  - Note: this will be further refined in the future (CSS is not my forte, evidently)
